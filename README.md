## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the feasablility of implementing a bike-sharing service in Iowa, use the data visualizations to support a business proposal, and learn about Tableau.

 For deliverable 1, the trip duration column needs to be changed from integer to a dateTime format.

 First, the citibike data from 2019-08 is imported into a pandas dataFrame. Then the tripduration column (in seconds) is converted.

 The tripduration data is now converted to datetime, showing each trip in hours, minutes, and seconds (with a date of 1970-01-01.)

        There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)
